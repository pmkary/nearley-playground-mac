If you're looking for the actual site, it's [right here](https://omrelli.ug/nearley-playground/).

Otherwise, here's how to build this project:

0. **If you don't have `npm` or `yarn`, install** [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

1. **Open up a terminal and run**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bijection/nearley-playground.git
    ```

2. **cd into the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd nearley-playground
    ```

3. **Install the project dependencies**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    (you can also run `npm install`)

4. **Start the dev server**
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    (you can also run `npm start`)

5. **Open up a browser and go to** `http://localhost:4321`

6. **Edit some files in `nearley-playground/src/client`.**
    
    When you save your edits, and the browser will automatically reload.

7. (optional) **Add a bunch of great functionality and send a PR!**
